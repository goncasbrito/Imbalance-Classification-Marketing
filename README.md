# Predicting Term Deposit Subscription

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to understand and predict customer behavior in terms of subscribing to a term deposit after being contacted by the bankâ€™s marketing campaigns. The core objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit, and evaluate the effectiveness of the bank's marketing strategies.

Given that the dataset contains unbalanced classes (with a larger number of customers who did not subscribe), the focus is on demonstrating how ensemble methods can help handle this imbalance and improve prediction performance.
